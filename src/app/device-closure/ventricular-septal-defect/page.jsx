      "Yes, most people live a healthy, normal life after successful VSD closure procedure, with regular follow-ups.",

    question: "What is the price of VSD surgery?",

      "The cost of VSD surgery in Mumbai can range from ₹2.5 to ₹5 lakhs, depending on the hospital and approach used.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How long does a VSD device closure procedure take?",
    answer:
      "The device closure procedure usually takes about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the complexity of the defect and the patient’s condition.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is the recovery time for VSD surgery/procedure?",
    answer:
      "Recovery after ventricular septal defect surgery typically takes 4 to 6 weeks, with shorter recovery for catheter-based closures.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What size VSD requires surgery?",
    answer:
      "A moderate to large VSD, especially with left-to-right shunting or symptoms, may require VSD closure surgery or catheter-based closure to prevent heart and lung damage.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What medication is given after VSD closure?",
    answer:
      "After a VSD closure procedure, most patients are given blood thinners or antiplatelet drugs for several months to prevent clot formation around the closure site.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How risky is a VSD closure procedure?",
    answer:
      "The VSD closure surgery procedure is safe in expert hands. Device closures have a low complication rate, while surgical repair may carry slightly higher risks but excellent long-term outcomes.",

  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What is the difference between VSD and a normal heart?",
    answer:
      "In a normal heart, the ventricular septum fully separates the two lower chambers. A VSD is a hole in that wall, causing abnormal blood flow and increased strain on the heart and lungs, requiring VSD Closure surgery in Mumbai for correction.",
