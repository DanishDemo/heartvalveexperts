          "A Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) is a small, congenital opening between the heart’s upper chambers (atria) that can allow blood clots to bypass the lungs and potentially cause strokes. The PFO closure procedure is a minimally invasive technique in which a closure device is delivered through a catheter inserted via the femoral vein in the groin to seal this opening.
