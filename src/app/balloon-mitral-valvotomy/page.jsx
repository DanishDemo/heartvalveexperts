A balloon-tipped catheter is guided through the femoral vein into the heart, crossing from the right atrium to the left via a transseptal puncture. Once positioned across the narrowed mitral valve, the balloon is inflated to widen the opening and improve blood flow between the left atrium and ventricle.",
