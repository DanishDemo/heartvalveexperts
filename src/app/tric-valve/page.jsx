    question: "Is the TricValve procedure safe?",
    answer:
      "Yes. It is a CE-approved system designed for high-risk patients who cannot undergo traditional tricuspid valve repair surgery in Mumbai. It avoids open-heart surgery, reducing complications.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question:
      "What is the difference between TricValve and traditional tricuspid valve replacement?",
    answer:
      "TricValve is a non-surgical treatment for severe tricuspid regurgitation, where two bioprosthetic valves are placed in the vena cavae to reduce backflow without removing the native valve. In contrast, traditional tricuspid valve replacement is an open-heart surgery where the tricuspid valve is removed and replaced with a mechanical or tissue valve, requiring general anesthesia and a longer recovery.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How much does TricValve therapy cost in Mumbai?",
    answer:
      "Cost varies based on patient condition, hospital stay, and support care, but is generally less than open-heart tricuspid valve replacement surgery in Mumbai due to reduced ICU time and faster recovery.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Who is not eligible for TricValve?",
    answer:
      "Patients with active infections, intracardiac thrombus, or advanced left heart failure may not be suitable. A detailed evaluation by a heart specialist in Mumbai is necessary.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What are the contraindications for TricValve?",
    answer:
      "A recent myocardial infarction that occurred within less than a month, severe vena cava obstruction, or known allergy to device materials are contraindications of TricValve Surgery.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How does TricValve work?",
    answer:
      "TricValve uses two bioprosthetic valves implanted in the superior and inferior vena cava to prevent backflow from the right ventricle to the right atrium, easing symptoms of severe tricuspid regurgitation without removing the native valve.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "How long does the TricValve procedure take?",
    answer:
      "The procedure typically takes about 1 to 2 hours and is performed under local anesthesia.",

          "TricValve is a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure designed for patients with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation who are not suitable candidates for open-heart surgery. Also called the transcatheter bicaval valve system, it implants two biological valves into the superior and inferior vena cava to manage the abnormal flow caused by a leaky tricuspid valve, reducing symptoms like leg swelling, liver congestion, and breathlessness.",
          "Unlike conventional tricuspid valve repair surgery/procedure in Mumbai, this method avoids opening the chest or manipulating the native valve. The implanted valves reroute venous return, lowering stress on the heart and organs. For those seeking alternatives to tricuspid valve replacement surgery, TricValve offers a safer, faster-recovery option guided by expert heart surgeons in Mumbai.",
